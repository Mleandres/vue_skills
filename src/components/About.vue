    <h1>This is an about page</h1>
    <p>Honestly, there are just so many things I could talk about in this about page. But really, what good is talking about it when I can just think about it instead. Hmmm. Yes. Many thoughts are in my head right now. Should I perhaps share those thoughts with you? The user? The webpage viewer? Is it not you who comes to this site in search of knowledge, meaning, or understanding? Perhaps. But also perhaps not! for this is the universe which we are forced to reside in. Wondering what could have been had our thoughts been known at a different place in spacetime. Disgustingly trapped by our own perceptions.</p>
    <p>But anyway, I digress. Thanks for visiting.</p>
